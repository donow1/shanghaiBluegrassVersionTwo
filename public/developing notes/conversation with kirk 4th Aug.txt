1) I'll put the songbook PDF in the notion, so it doesn't need to be on the website, 
2) Rag has to pay for Meetup, so if we could bascialyl replciate it on the site that would be better, 
3) embedding the newsletter would be a priority, maybe higher up in the page, or it could have it's own page also


1 newsletter should sit under the intro photo, to clearly indicate the community is still active

2 Learning tab: Let's go with  "Learn and Share" for now :)  DONE

3 Support us: Maybe a contact submissino form? So we don't have to post an email address on the site


4  Bluegrass, maybe we could change the title to something simpler: "China  Bluegrass" or so
