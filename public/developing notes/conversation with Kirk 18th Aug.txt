Hey, Kirk! Thank you for your feedback and thoughts. I loved the new ideas and I really appreciate that you being working so hard to build content across all the platforms :)

Here are a few thoughts/solutions to ideas you mentioned yesterday: 


1 LinkedIn: I can added it at the footer area along with Facebook and Youtube--- add to the footer ---https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirkkenney/ ----DONE

2 Front pictures : I’ve been talking to people from the community, and most of them have agreed to use media content that includes them. Before we finally deploy the website on a host, I will double-check with those I haven’t contacted yet to ensure everyone’s privacy is respected. --- edit the first one ---DONE

3 Visual map: Love the idea, we can make it as a pop up on the site once someone clicks the "Website Map" button ---- write one and send to kirk later ( can use the DOM extansion)


4 Admin: So far, this website is running on my PC. When we deploy the site, we can discuss about it again :) ---- explain to kirk later; maybe consider using Wix?

5 make a difference --- being part of a history: This title is for the ""Contact Us" section, which people can reach out and offer helps (via submitting the form). How about we can change "Join Us in Making a Difference!" to somehting like "Join us and Being Part of a Unique History"? --- DONE


6 Red: It's a good idea, especially for users can't access to facebook or youtube. Would you like it to added at the footer with other social medias? ---- no, this is the learn and share part ---DONE




7 timeline: Maybe under the Contact Us section, we can add a line with hyperlink to a notion page where cocnsists the history/record of people's contribution to the community?
It may look like this: ------ under the join us be part of the history   --- Done
